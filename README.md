# :heavy_exclamation_mark: About the Project
This Number-Puzzle-Game project will test the player patience and skills of the player. This game can be played by anyone at all ages, a kid, a teen and/or can be played by our grandparents. This is a modern take of a wooden puzzle game invented way back on 1970s. This program has a lot of sample in internet so I decided to elevate the program by making some parts, adding log in form to take the name of the player, and also some forms to adds excitement to the game like adding some music that will relax the player's mind while solving the puzzle. 
Hope you enjoy it! :sparkling_heart: :crossed_fingers:
